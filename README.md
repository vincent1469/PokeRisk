# PokéRisk
 Top-down game I made based on the popular game Risk of Rain, using Pokémon characters!

Possible features in development: 
Level system
Different Biomes
Boss Battles
New enemies/selectable player Pokémon sprites

Known Issues:
Unable to figure out how to make enemy sprites stop moving
Player sometimes gets taken off screen without getting clamped back into the game
